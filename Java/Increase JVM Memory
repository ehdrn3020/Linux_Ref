#some reason the garbage collector is taking an excessive amount of time (by default 98% of all CPU time of the process) 
 and recovers very little memory in each run (by default 2% of the heap).
 This effectively means that your program stops doing any progress and is busy running only the garbage collection at all time.
 To prevent your application from soaking up CPU time without getting anything done, 
 the JVM throws this Error so that you have a chance of diagnosing the problem.
