##Error Mesege##
Kernal Panic - Not syncing : VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)

yum update 중 뭔가가 잘못 되어서 kernel이 꼬인 것


##solution##
1. kernel selection in booting
the one at the top is the recently updated kernel and other is below.
choose old one.

2. delete wrong kernel
$ rpm -qa | grep kernel
$ yum remove -y kernel-2.6.32-696.3.3.el6.x86_64 (wrong update kernel)
$ yum update -y
